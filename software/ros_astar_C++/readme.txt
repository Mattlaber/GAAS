-> my_dir contains the supporting files required for Navigator.cpp, like all the astar and pathsmoothing files

-> build this package in your catkin workspace and run the gi_navigator_node. This is just like running python Navigator.py

-> I made ensure all the function names and variables are similar to the python version for smooth understanding. 

-> STILL IN DEBUGGING STAGE. Any help would be appreciated.
